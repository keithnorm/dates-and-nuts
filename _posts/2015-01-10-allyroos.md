Have you ever craved a Snicker's bar but held off because you don't want to eat all of that fake junk? We have your answer. Meet the Alli-roo!

1. Mix up almonds, cashews, and dates in a food processor until fully blended. The consistency should be kind of sticky so try to press it and see if it can hold together. If not, add another date and continue blending.

2. Once blended, add a few extra nuts and a dash of chocolate chips to the mixture and pulse the mixture a couple of times. This lets you have some bigger chunks of nuts in the mixture, which I think gives it a nice texture.

3. Spoon and press down mixture evenly into the cups of a muffin pan (I use 12-cup muffin tin). The consistency should be sticky enough to press them down and pack them in pretty well.

4. Optional: Spoon a small bit of peanut butter on each cup.

5. Melt chocolate chips in microwave or on double boiler until melted. Spoon chocolate over the cups (I swirl the spoon around to get it even) and try to cover the top of the date and nut bar completely.

6. Place pan in freezer for an hour to harden. Pop them out of the pan and store in another container in the freezer. No need to thaw before you eat as they are delicious cold. Perfect for breakfast, a snack before working out, or dessert!
